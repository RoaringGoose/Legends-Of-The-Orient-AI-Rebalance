# Rebalance of Pilaw's Legends of the Orient AIs

The Legends of the Orient AIs were originally created by Crusader Pilaw, see:

- [Pilaw's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@crusaderpilaw)
- [Pilaw's GitHub](https://github.com/CrusaderPilaw)

Pilaw created his AIs for a vanilla Stronghold Crusader with 4000 starting gold.
I adapted some of his AIs to work with the 2022 AI tournament rebalance (rules, balance etc can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I3LJSpRaL3ruSVSKY1RUlle6BIdReGWk)), which uses different building costs, unit stats and starting resources (500 gold).

Currently, only the following AIs got a rework:

- Robber-Baron (Raubritter): 1 castle
- Snail (Schnecke): 2 castles

Only the German locale has been updated, if any.
