# Rebalance of Pilaw's Legends of the Orient AIs

The Legends of the Orient AIs were originally created by Crusader Pilaw, see:

- [Pilaw's GitHub](https://github.com/CrusaderPilaw)

I adapted some of his AIs to work with the 2022 AI tournament rebalance (rules, balance etc can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I3LJSpRaL3ruSVSKY1RUlle6BIdReGWk)).
